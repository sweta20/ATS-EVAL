Staff believe that in the middle of the night, while the aquarium was deserted, Inky clambered to the top of his glass enclosure, down the side of the tank and traveled across the floor of the aquarium. Rob Yarrell, national manager of the National Aquarium of New Zealand in Napier, said: “Octopuses are famous escape artists.

3,Bangladeshi Organization Delivers a Lesson on Ending Child Labor,"For 14 years, SOHAY, a grassroots non-governmental organization (NGO) funded by the Global Fund for Children and Comic Relief, has been working in slum areas of Dhaka to get child laborers into school. It focuses on children working in hazardous conditions – in aluminum and plastic factories, and tanneries. The classroom is one of 23 urban development centers that SOHAY has set up across the capital. The centers prepare children for primary school with classes that help them catch up on their education. Once they are in primary school, the children can do homework at the centers, with help from their peers. Alamin, ten, who used to work in a plastic factory, attends one of the centers. His father is a street seller and his mother a part-time domestic worker. They are all happy that he’s now in school and away from hazardous work.

The condition affects individuals in different ways, but is characterized by difficulties in social interaction and communication. So far, there is no effective treatment for the social problems caused by autism. Researchers at Yale have studied the brain chemical oxytocin as a possible treatment for the social impairments caused by autism. It plays a key role in bonding and trust. Results have been mixed, though: one recent study found no significant benefit for youths given the chemical over several days.

13,John Lewis Christmas Advertisement 2015: Raising Awareness for Age UK,"After two years of successful ads featuring cuddly animals – a bear and hare, then a penguin – this time, the retailer is tugging at the heartstrings with a story of a young girl, Lily, who spots an old man living in a shack on the moon through her telescope. The determined child tries sending him a letter and firing a note via bow and arrow, before floating him a present of a telescope tied to balloons, which finally enables them to make contact. The ad’s strapline is: “Show someone they’re loved this Christmas,” which echoes Age UK’s own campaign: “No one should have no one at Christmas.” Profits from three products – a mug, gift tag and card – will go to the charity. “The charity really resonates with people at this time of year and the ad lends itself to thinking about someone who lives on your street that might not see anybody,” said Rachel Swift, head of marketing at John Lewis.",Adv,Using balloons,John Lewis,A note,"

12,Japan Calls Time on Long Hours Work Culture,"Japanese workers are allowed to take an average of 18.5 days of paid vacation per year, which is only two days fewer than the global average. The minimum requirement for paid vacation is ten days, and there are also 15 national holidays that workers can take off. However, many workers don't use their full entitlement and only take around nine days of paid vacation on average. In contrast to British workers who commonly take two weeks off during the summer, Japanese workers typically see a four-night vacation as a luxury. The government is considering making it mandatory for workers to take at least five days of paid holiday a year. This move comes as some companies have started encouraging their employees to nap during work hours to increase their productivity. The goal is to increase the number of days Japanese employees take off to match the average of British workers, who take around 20 days of paid vacation per year, and French workers, who take around 25 days.",chatgpt_out,The question or the answer options are not supported by the passage.,Japan will follow in the footsteps of other countries’ paid leave culture,The question or the answer options are not supported by the passage.,"

1,A New Form of Lie Detector Test,"The polygraph is commonly used in criminal cases and for security clearance by the FBI and CIA in the United States, but it is not as popular in Europe. Many scientists and legal experts have questioned its reliability. However, the researchers who developed the new method have conducted successful experiments. The new method uses an all-body motion suit, similar to those used in films to create computer-generated characters, to detect fidgeting, which is a common sign of lying. Ross Anderson, a member of the research team, explained that previous research showed that interviewers could only detect lies slightly better than random guessing. In contrast, their new method achieved a reliability rating of over 70%, and in some tests, they achieved more than 80%. Anderson concluded that guilty people tend to fidget more, and they can measure this accurately using their new method.",chatgpt_out,Create computer-generated characters,Body motions that show whether someone is guilty,A researcher on the team developing the new method for lie-detection,"

Only one pair in each family group reproduces once a year, and all pack members take care of the young together. The scientist is confused by the bad reputation of wolves and wonders why they are portrayed as ""lone-wolf gunmen"" or as the big bad wolf in Little Red Riding Hood.
